    "10. A plant pesticide according to claim 9 wherein the pesticide comprises about 0.3% (w/v) sulphur.",
    "I I. A plant pesticide according to any one of claims 1 to 10 wherein the pesticide further comprises a carrier.",
    "12. A plant pesticide according to claim 11 wherein the carrier is selected from the group consisting of: water, stabilizers, emulsifiers, oils, surfactants, antioxidants and UN screens.",
    "13. A plant pesticide according to claim 12 wherein the surfactant is a non-ionic surfactant.",
    "14. A plant pesticide according to claim 13 wherein the surfactant is a non-ionic organic surfactant.",
    "15. A plant pesticide according to claim 14 wherein the surfactant is nonylphenoxy polyethoxyethanol.",
    "16. A plant pesticide according to any one of claims 12 to 15 wherein the pesticide comprises 0.01 to 0.1 % surfactant.",
    "17. A plant pesticide according to claim 16 wherein the pesticide comprises about 0.03% (w/v) surfactant.",
    "18. A plant pesticide according to any one of claims 1 to 17 wherein the plant is an ornamental plant.",
    "19. A plant pesticide according to claim 18 wherein the ornamental plant is a carnation, rose, lavender, tulip, delphinium or dahlia.",
    "20. A plant pesticide according to any one of claims 1 to 17 wherein the plant is a fruit plant.",
    "21. A plant pesticide according to claim 20 wherein the fruit plant is a stone fruit tree, citrus fruit tree, grape vine, strawberry, coffee, banana, tomato, rockmelon or watermelon plant.",
    "22. A plant pesticide according to any one of claims 1 to 17 wherein the plant is an herb or a medicinal plant.",

    "37. A method according to claim 36 wherein the pesticide is applied in the pre-infection treatment at intervals of 1 to 10 days.",
    "38. A method according to claim 37 wherein the pesticide is applied twice during the pre-infection treatment at about a 4-day interval.",
    "39. A method according to claim 36 wherein the maintenance treatment is applied 2 to 10 weeks after the pre-infection treatment.",
    "40. A method according to claim 39 wherein the maintenance treatment is applied 4-5 weeks after the pre-infection treatment and optionally reapplied at 2 to 8 week intervals or 4-5 week intervals.",
    "41. A method according to claim 36 wherein a first post-infection treatment is applied upon the appearance of signs of pest infection.",
    "42. A method according to claim 37 wherein a further post-infection treatment is applied.",
    "43. A method according to claim 42 wherein the further post-infection treatment is carried out 3 to 6 weeks after the first post-infection treatment.",
    "44. A method according to claim 44 wherein the further post-infection treatment is carried out 4 to 5 weeks after the first post-infection treatment.",
    "45. A method according to claim 36 wherein two pre-infection treatments are carried out at an interval of 4 days, followed by a first maintenance treatment 4 to 5 weeks after the last pre-infection treatment, and a further maintenance treatment 4 to 5 weeks after the first maintenance treatment.",
    "46. A process for preparing a plant pesticide according any one of claims 1 to 25 comprising combining an avermectin with sulphur or a sulphur-containing compound.",
    "47. A plant pesticide comprising about 0.0008% (w/v) avermectin, about 0.3%> (w/v) sulphur and about 0.03% (w/v) non-ionic organic surfactant."
