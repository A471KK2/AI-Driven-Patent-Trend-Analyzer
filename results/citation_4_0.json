  "abstract": "Water dispersible fiber products are provided. In one embodiment, a water dispersible fiber sheet is provided and it is preferably formed from regenerated cellulose fibers, a second fiber that is adapted to provide strength to the water dispersible fiber sheet, and a water soluble binder. In use, the fiber sheet can be formed into a variety of products including, for example, for labels, packaging, medical and health care products. The fiber sheet is particularly advantageous in that it is readily dispersible upon contact with water, yet it will retain its strength when used with other fluids, such as alcohol and oils. The biodegradability of the fiber sheet will also allow the fibers to be consumed naturally by environmental bacteria, thus eliminating the need for special disposal procedures. In another embodiment, the water dispersible fiber sheet can be incorporated into a filter media.",
