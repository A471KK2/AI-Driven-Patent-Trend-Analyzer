The parent module may have a fuselage, forward and aft wings connected to the fuselage, and a first plurality of flight propulsion devices. The child modules have a corresponding second plurality of flight propulsion devices. Each child module docks wingtip-to-wingtip with the parent module or an adjacent edge of a child module using the docking mechanisms. The child modules undock and separate from the forward wing and each other, and achieve controlled flight independently of the parent module while in the second flight configuration.
