    "2. A process according to claim 1 wherein said lactic acid prepolymer is produced by the polycondensation of lactic acid in said batch-type polymerization reactor in such a way that the by-product water is removed by a degasification procedure while the unreacted lactic acid, as well as the produced lactide and low molecular weight compounds that have been distilled off together with the by-product water are refluxed to said batch-type polymerization reactor.",
    "3. A process according to claim 2 wherein lactide is added to said lactic acid.",
    "4. A process according to claim 2 wherein said refluxing is performed in vacua at a pressure of 0.1-100 mmHg.",
    "5. A process according to claim 2 wherein said refluxing is performed under heating at a temperature of 90\u00b0-180\u00b0 C.",
    "6. A process according to claim 2 wherein a solvent is added when said unreacted lactic acid, as well as said produced lactide and low molecular weight compounds that have been distilled off together with the by-product water are refluxed to said batch-type polymerization reactor.",
    "7. A process according to claim 6 wherein said refluxing is performed under heating at a temperature of 50\u00b0-130\u00b0 C.",
    "8. A process according to claim 1 wherein said polylactic acid is produced by the polycondensation of said lactic acid prepolymer in said screw-type extruder in such a way that the by-product water is removed by a degasification procedure while the unreacted lactic acid, as well as produced lactide and low molecular weight compounds that have been distilled off together with the by-product water are refluxed to said screw-type extruder.",

    "13. A process according to claim 12 wherein said refluxing is performed under heating at a temperature of 50\u00b0-130\u00b0 C.",
    "14. A process according to claim 1 wherein lactic acid polymer having a weight-average molecular weight of 80,000-250,000 is added to said lactic acid prepolymer when it is fed into said screw-type extruder.",
    "15. A process according to claim 1 wherein any solvents that remain in said lactic acid prepolymer are removed by a devolatilization procedure in said screw-type extruder.",
    "16. A process for direct production of a shaped article of lactic acid polymer comprising the steps of polycondensing lactic acid to a lactic acid prepolymer having a weight-average molecular weight of 10,000-50,000 in a batch-type polymerization reactor, polycondensing said lactic acid prepolymer to lactic acid polymer having a weight-average molecular weight of at least 100,000 by means of a screw-type extruder which forms a second reactor, and shaping said lactic acid polymer by extrusion from said screw-type extruder."
