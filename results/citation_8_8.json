An aircraft capable of helicopter and fixed wing flight modes, comprising:\na plurality of wings, each wing having a spar and a flap, the flap being movable with respect to the spar; a flap actuator configured to move the flap; and a center section rotatably coupled to each spar and including at least one spar actuator, the spar actuator being configured to rotate at least one of the plurality of wings about a rotational axis of the spar when the aircraft transitions between helicopter and fixed wing flight modes.",
    "2. The aircraft of claim 1, wherein the center section further comprises at least one torsionally flexible element coupled to the at least one spar actuator.",
    "3. The aircraft of claim 2, wherein the torsionally flexible element is a spring.",
    "4. The aircraft of claim 1, wherein the spar comprises a strap pack coupled to the center section.",
    "5. The aircraft of claim 4, wherein the strap pack is configured to move the plurality of wings to a leading-edge up orientation in the absence of aerodynamic, inertial, and actuator forces.",
    "6. The aircraft of claim 1, wherein the aircraft further comprises:\na closed loop control system comprising a teeter pin and one or more snubber blocks, wherein the control system is configured to control motion of the plurality of wings about a longitudinal axis of the teeter pin.",
    "7. The aircraft of claim 1, wherein an aerodynamic center of each wing is located aft of the rotational axis of the spar.",
    "8. A method for transitioning an aircraft between flight modes, the method comprising:\nchanging the motion of a center section of the aircraft relative to a fuselage of the aircraft from a first flight mode to a second flight mode, wherein the direction of relative airflow over one of a plurality of wings reverses when the aircraft transitions from the first to the second flight mode; and rotating the one of a plurality of wings such that a leading edge of the wing faces into the new direction of relative airflow.",
    "9. The method of claim 8, wherein the center section rotates relative to the fuselage in the first flight mode and does not rotate relative to the fuselage in the second flight mode.",
    "10. The method of claim 8, wherein the center section does not rotate relative to the fuselage in the first flight mode and rotates relative to the fuselage in the second flight mode.",
    "11. The method of claim 8 further comprising:\nchanging the orientation of a tail rotor relative to the fuselage, wherein the tail rotor is oriented in a first position when the aircraft is in the first flight mode and oriented in a second position when the aircraft is in the second flight mode, and wherein the first and second positions are different.",
    "12. The method of claim 11 further comprising:\nchanging the orientation of the tail rotor from the first position to the second position when the aircraft is in either the first or second flight mode.",
    "13. An aircraft capable of helicopter and fixed wing flight modes, comprising:\nmeans for changing the motion of a center section of the aircraft relative to a fuselage of the aircraft from a first flight mode to a second flight mode, wherein the direction of relative airflow over one of a plurality of wings reverses when the aircraft transitions from the first to the second flight mode; and means for rotating the one of a plurality of wings such that a leading edge of the wing faces into the new direction of relative airflow.",
    "14. The aircraft of claim 13, wherein the means for changing the motion of a center section comprises a motor, a transmission, a motor controller, and a microcontroller.",
    "15. The aircraft of claim 13, wherein the means for rotating comprises at least one spar actuator connected to at least one of the plurality of wings.",
    "16. The aircraft of claim 15, wherein the at least one spar actuator is configured to control the collective pitch of the plurality of wings.",
    "17. The aircraft of claim 13 further comprising means for controlling the cyclic pitch of the plurality of wings.",
    "18. The aircraft of claim 17, wherein the means for controlling cyclic pitch comprises a plurality of flap actuators mounted on each of the plurality of wings.",
    "19. The aircraft of claim 13 further comprising means for controlling motion of the plurality of wings about a longitudinal axis of a teeter pin.",
