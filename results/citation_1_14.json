    "1. A method for preparing a biodegradable composition for the preparation of table-ware, mulching film and package, the method comprising:\n(1) treating one or more plant wastes selected from the group consisting of sugar cane residue, peanut shell, dry pine needle, rice husk, millet bran and soybean shell soaked in a 0.2-1.0% by weight of sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid solution for 2-10 hours to degrease and modify and to wash, and then drying the same to let it have a water content of less than 10%; mixing the obtained plant wastes with starch, sorbitol, polypropylene, and polyethylene, and pulverizing the obtained mixture to obtain a powder with a particle size of larger than 70 mesh; mixing the obtained powder with calcium carbonate, stearic acid, stearate, coupling agent, defoamer, glycerine or epoxidized soybean oil and photosensitizer homogeneously; and (2) blending the mixture obtained in step (1) in a double-screw extruder at a temperature of 160-180\u00b0 C. to obtain the biodegradable composition which comprises 2-6% by weight of starch, 35-45% by weight of plant wastes, 20-30% by weight of calcium carbonate; 2-7% by weight of sorbitol, 7-13% by weight of polypropylene, 2-5% by weight of polyethylene, 2-6% by weight of coupling agent, 1-2% by weight of defoamer, 2-5% by weight of stearic acid, 2-6% by weight of stearate, 3-6% by weight of glycerine or epoxidized soybean oil, and 60-100 ppm photosensitizer.",
    "2. The method according claim 1, wherein the biodegradable composition comprises: 3-5% by weight of starch, 35-40% by weight of plant wastes, 20-30% by weight of calcium carbonate, 4-6% by weight of sorbitol, 8-11% by weight of polypropylene, 3-4% by weight of polyethylene, 3-5% by weight of coupling agent, 1-2% by weight of defoamer, 3-4% by weight of stearic acid, 3-5% by weight of stearate, 3-5% by weight of glycerine or epoxidized soybean oil, and 60-100 ppm photosensitizer.",
    "3. The method according claim 1, wherein the biodegradable composition comprises: 3% by weight of starch, 37% by weight of plant wastes, 25% by weight of calcium carbonate, 5% by weight of sorbitol, 9% by weight of polypropylene, 3% by weight of polyethylene, 5% by weight of coupling agent, 4% by weight of stearic acid, 4% by weight of stearate, 1% by weight of defoamer, 4% by weight of glycerine or epoxidized soybean oil and 60 ppm photosensitizer.",
    "4. The method according claim 1, wherein the starch is at least one selected from the groups consisting of corn starch, potato starch, ipomoea batatas starch, cassaya starch and a modified starch thereof with a grain size of larger than 70 mesh.",
    "5. The method according claim 1, wherein the calcium carbonate is light or heavy alcium carbonate with a grain size of larger than 70 mesh.",
    "6. The method according claim 1, wherein the coupling agent is silane.",
    "7. The method according claim 1, wherein the stearate is iron stearate, magnesium stearate or calcium stearate.",
    "8. The method according claim 1, wherein the stearate is iron stearate.",
    "9. The method according claim 1, wherein the photosensitizer is benzophenone.",
    "10. The method according claim 1, wherein the defoamer is emulsified silicone oil."
