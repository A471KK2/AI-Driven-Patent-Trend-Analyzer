  "abstract": "Systems and methods include providing an aircraft with a fuselage and a wing assembly rotatable relative to the fuselage about a stow axis between a flight position and a stowed position. The aircraft includes a gearbox having a retractable driveshaft that selectively engages the mid-wing gearbox via axially translatable motion along a rotation axis when the wing assembly is in the flight position. The retractable driveshaft also selectively disengages the mid-wing gearbox in the flight position to allow selectively rotation of the wing assembly about the stow axis from the flight position to the stowed position resulting in the mid-wing gearbox being misaligned with the retractable driveshaft when the wing assembly is in the stowed position.",

    "1. A stow system, comprising:\na main body; a rotatable component comprising an auxiliary gearbox, the rotatable component being rotatable relative to the main body about a first axis; and a retractable driveshaft configured to selectively engage the auxiliary gearbox via axially translatable motion along a second axis that is offset from the first axis.",
    "2. The stow system of claim 1, wherein the rotatable component is rotatable about the stow axis between a first position and a second position.",
    "3. The stow system of claim 1, wherein the auxiliary gearbox is aligned with the retractable driveshaft along the rotation axis when the rotatable component is in the first position.",
    "4. The stow system of claim 1, wherein the retractable driveshaft is selectively actuated to engage and disengage the auxiliary gearbox when the wing assembly is in the flight position.",
    "5. The stow system of claim 1, wherein the retractable driveshaft is selectively retracted to disengage the auxiliary gearbox in the first position to allow selective rotation of the rotatable component about the stow axis from the first position to the second position.",
    "6. The stow system of claim 1, wherein the auxiliary gearbox is misaligned with the retractable driveshaft when the rotatable component is in the second position.",
    "7. An aircraft, comprising:\na fuselage; a wing assembly comprising a mid-wing gearbox, the wing assembly being rotatable relative to the fuselage about a stow axis; and a retractable driveshaft configured to selectively engage the mid-wing gearbox via axially translatable motion along a rotation axis of the retractable driveshaft that is offset from the stow axis.",
    "8. The aircraft of claim 7, wherein the stow axis is located forward of the rotation axis.",
    "9. The aircraft of claim 7, wherein the wing assembly is rotatable about the stow axis between a flight position and a stowed position.",
    "10. The aircraft of claim 9, wherein the mid-wing gearbox is aligned with the retractable driveshaft along the rotation axis when the wing assembly is in the flight position, such that the retractable driveshaft can selectively engage the mid-wing gearbox when the wing assembly is in the flight position.",
    "11. The aircraft of claim 10, wherein the retractable driveshaft is selectively actuated vertically with respect to the fuselage to engage and disengage the mid-wing gearbox when the wing assembly is in the flight position.",
    "12. The aircraft of claim 10, wherein the retractable driveshaft is selectively actuated horizontally with respect to the fuselage to engage and disengage the mid-wing gearbox when the wing assembly is in the flight position.",
    "13. The aircraft of claim 10, wherein when the retractable driveshaft is engaged with the mid-wing gearbox, rotational motion of the retractable driveshaft imparted by at least one of an internal combustion engine and an electrical motor is transferred through interconnect driveshafts coupled to the mid-wing gearbox in order to impart rotation to a plurality of rotor assemblies disposed on the wing assembly.",
    "14. The aircraft of claim 9, wherein the retractable driveshaft is selectively retracted vertically to disengage the mid-wing gearbox in the flight position to allow selective rotation of the wing assembly about the stow axis from the flight position to the stowed position.",
    "15. The aircraft of claim 14, wherein the mid-wing gearbox is misaligned with the retractable driveshaft when the wing assembly is in the stowed position.",
    "16. The aircraft of claim 7, wherein the aircraft comprises a vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft configured for operation in each of an airplane mode and a helicopter mode.",
    "17. A method of operating an aircraft, comprising:\nproviding an aircraft with a fuselage, a wing assembly comprising a mid-wing gearbox and being rotatable relative to the fuselage about a stow axis between a flight position and a stowed position, and a retractable driveshaft configured to selectively engage the mid-wing gearbox via axially translatable motion along a rotation axis of the retractable driveshaft that is offset from the stow axis when the wing assembly is in the flight position; selectively retracting the retractable driveshaft axially along the rotation axis to disengage the retractable driveshaft from the mid-wing gearbox when the wing assembly is in the flight position; and rotating the wing assembly about the stow axis from the flight position to the stowed position that results in the mid-wing gearbox being misaligned with the retractable driveshaft.",
    "18. The method of claim 17, further comprising: operating the combustion engine without engaging rotor assemblies of the aircraft.",
    "19. The method of claim 17, further comprising: rotating the wing assembly about the stow axis from the stowed position to the flight position to align the mid-wing gearbox with the retractable driveshaft.",
    "20. The method of claim 19, further comprising: selectively actuating the retractable driveshaft axially along the rotation axis to engage the retractable driveshaft with the mid-wing gearbox when the wing assembly is in the flight position."
