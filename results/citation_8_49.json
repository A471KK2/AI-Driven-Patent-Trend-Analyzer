  "abstract": "An aircraft having a fuselage with a nose and a flat tail at opposite ends and a pair of wings extending therefrom. A pair of nacelles are detachably connected to the top of respective ones of the wings to be spaced from the fuselage to establish an air flow space therebetween. Each wing-mounted nacelle includes a plurality of fans, a corresponding plurality of electric motors to drive the fans, and dividers that separate the fans from one another. Each wing-mounted nacelle also includes a pair of rotatable air inlet slats at an air intake end and a pair of rotatable air exhaust flaps at an air exhaust end that are rotated relative to one another to control horizontal propulsive thrust, thrust vectoring and thrust reversing of the aircraft. A third nacelle is mounted on top of the flat tail of the fuselage between a pair of horizontal turbo generators.",

An aircraft comprising:\na fuselage;\na nose at one end of said fuselage;\na tail at an opposite end of said fuselage;\na pair of wings extending outwardly from said fuselage; and\na nacelle including a fan, an electric motor to power said fan, and an air flow-through duct surrounding said fan, said nacelle having an air intake end at which air is received by said air flow-through duct when the aircraft is in flight and an air exhaust end lying opposite said air intake end at which the air is exhausted from said air flow-through duct to the atmosphere,\nwherein the air exhaust end of said nacelle has a rotatable upper air exhaust flap and a rotatable lower air exhaust flap spaced one above the other, said rotatable upper air exhaust flap being rotatable from a horizontal position lying in parallel alignment with said air flow-through duct to an upturned position extending upwardly with respect to said air flow-through duct and to a downturned position extending downwardly with respect to said air flow-through duct, and said rotatable lower air exhaust flap being rotatable from a horizontal position lying in parallel alignment with said air flow-through duct and with the upper air exhaust flap in the horizontal position thereof to a downturned position extending downwardly with respect to said air flow-through duct at which to cooperate with said rotatable upper air exhaust flap in the upturned position thereof to control the direction of the air that is exhausted from the air flow-through duct at the air exhaust end of said nacelle,\nsaid nacelle also including rotatable upper and lower exhaust diverter flaps located within the air flow-through duct at the exhaust end of said nacelle between said rotatable upper and lower air exhaust flaps, said upper and lower exhaust diverter flaps being rotatable relative to said air flow-through duct from a horizontal position lying face-to-face with respect to one another and in parallel alignment with each of the upper air exhaust flap in the horizontal position thereof and the lower air exhaust flap in the horizontal position thereof to a downward position lying in parallel alignment with each of the upper air exhaust flap in the downturned position thereof and the lower air exhaust flap in the downturned position thereof.",
    "2. The aircraft recited in claim 1, wherein the upper and lower exhaust diverter flaps of said nacelle are also rotatable from said horizontal position thereof lying face-to-face with respect to one another to a position extending in different directions relative to one another such that the upper exhaust diverter flap lies in an axial alignment with the upper air exhaust flap in the upturned position thereof and the lower exhaust diverter flap lies in parallel alignment with the lower air exhaust flap in the downturned position thereof.",
    "3. The aircraft recited in claim 1, wherein said nacelle is located above one of the pair of wings extending outwardly from said fuselage.",
    "4. The aircraft recited in claim 3, further comprising another nacelle including another fan, another electric motor to power said another fan, and another air flow-through duct surrounding the another fan and the another electric motor, said another nacelle being located above the other one of said pair of wings extending outwardly from said fuselage.",
    "5. The aircraft recited in claim 1, wherein said nacelle is detachably connected to one of the pair of wings extending outwardly from said fuselage so that said nacelle is removable from the one of said pair of wings without having to remove the one of said wings from said fuselage.",
    "6. The aircraft recited n claim 1, wherein the air intake end of said nacelle includes a rotatable upper air inlet slat and a rotatable lower air inlet slat spaced one above the other, said rotatable upper and lower air inlet slats being rotatable from a horizontal position lying in parallel alignment with each other and with said air flow-through duct to a position lying at an angle with respect to said air flow-through duct to control the direction of the air flowing through the air intake end of said nacelle to said fan thereof.",
    "7. The aircraft recited in claim 1, wherein said nacelle also includes an intermediate air exhaust slat lying in axial alignment with the rotatable upper air exhaust flap in the horizontal position thereof at the air exhaust end of said nacelle so that said rotatable upper air exhaust flap in the horizontal position thereof extends rearwardly of the rotatable lower air exhaust flap in the horizontal position thereof.",
    "8. The aircraft recited in claim 7, wherein the intermediate air exhaust slat of said nacelle is rotatable from a horizontal position lying in said axial alignment with the rotatable upper air exhaust flap in the horizontal position thereof to a position extending upwardly with respect to the air flow-through duct of said nacelle at which to cooperate with said upper air exhaust flap in the upturned position thereof so that some of the air that is exhausted from the air exhaust end of said nacelle is exhausted between the intermediate air exhaust slat in the upwardly extending position thereof and the upper air exhaust flap in the upturned position thereof.",
    "9. The aircraft recited in claim 1, wherein said nacelle is positioned on top of said fuselage.",
    "10. The aircraft recited in claim 8, wherein the tail of said fuselage is flat, said nacelle positioned on top of said fuselage at said flat tail thereof.",
    "11. The aircraft recited in claim 10, wherein the flat tail of said fuselage is rotatable up and down to control the vertical pitch of the nose of said fuselage.",
    "12. The aircraft recited in claim 10, wherein the nacelle connected to said fuselage at the flat tail thereof has a yaw vane that is rotatable within said air flow-through duct to provide the aircraft with yaw control at low speeds.",
    "13. The aircraft recited in claim 1, further comprising a pair of turbo generators located in spaced parallel alignment with one another at the tail of said fuselage such that said nacelle lies between said pair of turbo generators.",
    "14. The aircraft recited in claim 13, wherein said fuselage includes a pressure bulkhead and a pressurized cabin located within said fuselage in which passengers are seated when the aircraft is in flight, said pair of turbo generators and said nacelle being located at the tail of said fuselage and rearwardly of each of said pressure bulkhead and said pressurized cabin of said fuselage.",
    "15. The aircraft recited in claim 13, further comprising a pair of horizontal tail sections extending outwardly and in opposite directions from the tail of said fuselage so that said nacelle is located between said pair of horizontal tail sections, said pair of horizontal tail sections being connected to respective ones of said pair of turbo generators by which said pair of turbo generators are held by said pair of horizontal tail sections in said spaced parallel alignment with one another.",
