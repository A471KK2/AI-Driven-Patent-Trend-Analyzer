  "abstract": "A binder composition for use in forming briquettes is disclosed. The composition comprises from about 5 to about 95% asphalt base and about 5 to about 95% sodium carbonate pulping liquor by weight. The binder composition may contain up to about 3% by weight of a surfactant, such as nonyl phenol ethoxylate, to increase homogeneity of briquette formation. Strength increasing additives such as latex, vinyl derivatives, cellulose, cellulose derivatives, peat moss, starch, starch derivatives, pulp from the pulp and paper industry, paper, cardboad, acrylic copolymers and combinations thereof, may be added to the binder composition in a total amount of up to about 10% by weight. Lignosulfonate may be added to the composition in an amount of up to about 30% by weight. An inorganic component such as cement or bentonite clay may be added in an amount of up to about 70% by weight, and up to about 30% by weight of a plasticizer such as rubber or plastic may be added. The binder composition may be used to agglomerate a briquette filler such as metal fines, coal fines, miniers, fly ash or other suitable briquette components.",
