  "abstract": "In order to produce thermoplastically processable starch, an additive or plasticizer respectively is mixed with native or natural starch and the mixture is caused to melt by the application of heat and mechanical energy. The additive is a substance which lowers the melting point of the starch so that the melting point of the starch together with this additive lies below the decomposition temperature of the starch and the additive furthermore has a solubility parameter of over 15 cal1/2 cm-3/2. After the mixture of starch and additive is molten, the melt is mixed until it is at least almost homogeneous. The vapor pressure of the additive within the melting range of the mixture of starch and additive should be less than one bar. Preferably the mixing process is executed without the presence of water.",
