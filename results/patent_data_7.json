The maize flour comprises a minor volume percent of the total volume of the bioplastic material. A biodegradable additive is used to provide a degree of stiffness to the material, a preferred additive being polylactic acid. A UV stabilizer may optionally be included. Biodegradable bags have an open end and a closed end with a sidewall extending therebetween. The bag includes a feature for enclosing a substance once placed into the bag. In an example, the feature comprises an opening through a sidewall. Alternatively, the feature may include an adhesive section.",
