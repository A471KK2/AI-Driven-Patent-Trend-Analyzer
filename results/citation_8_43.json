  "abstract": "The invention provides for a hybrid unmanned aerial and submersible vehicle (UASV) (100) comprising a fuselage (102), at least one wing structure (104, 106), a propulsion system (116, 118) and an empennage. The said vehicle is capable of operating in air, on water and underwater via its wing tilting mechanism wherein the transition of the vehicle between different mediums is seamless. Further, the wing structures (104, 106) are connected on either side of the fuselage (102), such that each wing (104, 106) tilts about a common lateral axis (360\u00b0 of freedom), and wherein said tilting depends on the mode of operation of the UASV (100). The vehicle of the present invention further includes a propeller protection system, a landing system, control surfaces, and sensors. The present invention also discloses methods for operating the UASV (100) in multiple mediums.",

    "1. An unmanned aerial and submersible vehicle (UASV) comprising:\na fuselage; a plurality of wing structures; and an actuator assembled at a tip of each of the plurality of wing structures; wherein the actuator enables tilting of each the plurality of wing structures about a common lateral axis to allow seamless transition of the UASV between multiple operating modes.",
    "2. The UASV of claim 1, wherein the multiple operating modes comprise an aerial mode, a floating mode and a submerged mode.",

    "15. The method of claim 13, wherein the plurality of wing structures are tilted independently or the plurality of wing structures are tilted simultaneously.",
    "16. (canceled)",
    "17. The method of claim 13, wherein positioning the plurality of wing structures in a vertical position (90\u00b0) results in a hovering scenario of the UASV, tilting the plurality of wing structures at an angle of 270\u00b0 results in a diving scenario of the UASV, and positioning the plurality of wing structures in a horizontal position (0\u00b0) results in a cruising scenario of the UASV.",
    "18. (canceled)",
    "19. (canceled)",
    "20. The method of claim 13, wherein the plurality of wing structures are two wing structures, wherein a first actuator is assembled at the tip of a first wing structure and a second actuator is assembled at the tip of a second wing structure.",

The method of claim 26, wherein positioning the first and second wing structures parallel to each other and tilted at +45\u00b0 enables a climbing action of the UASV, wherein positioning the first and second wing structures parallel to each other and tilted at \u221245\u00b0 enables a descending action of the unmanned aerial and submersible vehicle and tilting the first and second actuators in a direction wherein an angle between the first and second actuator is 180\u00b0 enables a yaw maneuver of the UASV.",
    "22. (canceled)",
    "23. The method of claim 26, wherein tilting the first actuator at +45\u00b0 and tilting the second actuator at \u221245\u00b0 enables a roll maneuver of the UASV during a submerged mode.",
    "24. The method of claim 26, wherein a flap positioned on each of the first and second wing structures enables a roll maneuver of the UASV during an aerial mode.",
    "25. (canceled)",
    "26. A method of transitioning between multiple operating modes of an unmanned aerial and submersible vehicle (UASV), the method comprising the steps of:\ntilting first and second actuators at particular angles, wherein the first and second actuators are assembled at the tip of respective first and second wing structures of the UASV; and determining a rotation speed of a propeller positioned on each of the first and second wing structures, depending on a current operating mode."
