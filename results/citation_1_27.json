  "abstract": "The present invention relates to a biodegradable resin composition and a preparation method thereof. The purpose of the present invention is to provide a biodegradable resin composition and a preparation method thereof, wherein biodegradable resin composition lifts commercialization restrictions of ordinary polylactic acid (PLA) due to lack of physical properties such as melting properties, plasticity and others by adjusting contents of polylactic acid and polybutylene succinate with a thermoplastic base resin, and can reduce preparation costs and has excellent biodegradable performance by comprising sea squirt skin cellulose, jellyfish (Aurelia aurita) collagen and carboxymethyl cellulose that has good processability, are inexpensive as a biodegradable material, and are easily synthesized. The biodegradable resin composition comprises: 100 parts by weight of a biodegradable thermoplastic base resin having a carboxyl group; and 10 to 40 parts by weight of a biodegradable material having a hydroxy group, wherein the biodegradable thermoplastic base resin is obtained by preparing, as a main component, an aliphatic (including alicyclic) glycol comprising any one or more selected from an aliphatic (including alicyclic) dicarboxylic acid (or anhydride thereof), 1,4-butanediol, and ethylene glycol, passing the aliphatic (including alicyclic) glycol through an esterification reaction, and performing a polycondensation reaction of the aliphatic (including alicyclic) glycol passing through the esterification reaction.",
