    "1. A system comprising:\nan aerial vehicle; a sensor coupled to the aerial vehicle; a winch system coupled to the aerial vehicle, wherein the winch system comprises a tether disposed on a spool, a motor operable to apply a torque to the tether, and a payload coupling apparatus coupled to a leading end of the tether and configured to mechanically couple to a payload; a repositioning apparatus configured to reposition the payload coupling apparatus in at least a horizontal direction; and a control system configured to:\nidentify the payload to be picked up by the aerial vehicle within an environment;\ncontrol the aerial vehicle to hover above the payload;\ncontrol the winch system to deploy the payload coupling apparatus by unwinding the tether from the spool;\nreceive, while the aerial vehicle hovers above the payload and from the sensor, sensor data indicative of a position of the payload coupling apparatus in relation to the payload; and\nwhile the aerial vehicle hovers above the payload, reposition, using the repositioning apparatus and based on the sensor data, the payload coupling apparatus in the horizontal direction to mechanically couple to the payload.",
    "2. The system of claim 1, wherein the control system is configured to control the aerial vehicle to hover above the payload and control the winch system to deploy the payload coupling apparatus by:\ncontrolling the position of the aerial vehicle in coordination with the winch system to maneuver the payload coupling apparatus to within a threshold distance of the payload; and based on the payload coupling apparatus being maneuvered to within the threshold distance of the payload, causing the aerial vehicle to hover in a fixed location above the payload to maintain the payload coupling apparatus within the threshold distance of the payload.",
    "3. The system of claim 1, wherein the control system is further configured to:\ndetermine a trajectory for the payload coupling apparatus to follow to mechanically couple to the payload, wherein the trajectory is defined in at least the horizontal direction, and wherein an end of the trajectory coincides with an attachment point for the payload coupling apparatus on the payload; and actuate the repositioning apparatus to reposition the payload coupling apparatus according to the trajectory.",
    "4. The system of claim 3, wherein the control system is further configured to:\nsuppress oscillation of the payload coupling apparatus as the payload coupling apparatus approaches the end of the trajectory to reduce a difference between a position indicated by the trajectory and an actual position of the payload coupling apparatus.",
