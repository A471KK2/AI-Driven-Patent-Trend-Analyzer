    "1. A control system for controlling rail-bound vehicles in a railway system, the control system comprising a controller arranged to determine present positions of rail-bound vehicles on at least one railway of the railway system, and to issue control signals to control the operation of said vehicles, wherein the present positions of said vehicles are determined based on radio signal measurements in at least one of the time domain and/or phase domain of wireless communication occurring between each vehicle and base stations arranged at predetermined positions in the vicinity of said railways.",
    "2. The control system of claim 1, wherein the radio signal measurements comprises measuring of a propagation time for radio signals transferred between the vehicles and the base stations.",
    "3. The control system of claim 2, wherein the propagation time is measured by measuring a round-trip time for a data packet to be sent from a first party to a second party, and a response to be sent back from the second party to the first party, and subtracting the round-trip time with a processing time of the second party before sending the response.",
    "4. The control system of claim 1, wherein the radio signal measurements comprises measuring of a phase difference of radio signals of different frequencies transferred between the vehicles and the base stations.",
    "5. The control system of claim 1, wherein the control system is a CBTC (Communication Based Train Control) system.",
    "6. The control system of claim 1, wherein the wireless communication is at least one of made by over a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) and made via a cellular network standard.",
    "7. The control system of claim 6, wherein the wireless communication is made by at least one of: WLAN and GSM-R.",
    "8. The control system of claim 1, wherein the base stations are trackside base stations distributed along the extension of the railway(s).",
    "9. The control system of claim 8, wherein the trackside base stations are access points for communication in compliance with a WLAN standard.",
    "10. The control system of claim 1, wherein the controller is further arranged to determine at least one of travelling speed and travelling direction for said rail-bound vehicles based on said radio signal measurements.",
    "11. The control system of claim 1, said system being adapted to control at least one of start, speed and stop of the rail-guided vehicles on said railway(s) based on said issued control signals.",
    "12. The control system of claim 1, further comprising a sensor arranged to determine which track that is selected when the vehicle passes through a junction.",
    "13. A method for controlling rail-bound vehicles in a railway system, the method comprising:\nmeasuring a radio signal in at least one of the time domain and/or the phase domain of wireless communication occurring between each vehicle and base stations arranged at predetermined positions in the vicinity of said railways; determining present positions of the rail-bound vehicles on at least one railway of the railway system based on said measurements; and issuing control signals to control the operation of said vehicles based on said determined present positions.",
    "14. An apparatus for determining a position of a rail-bound vehicle on a railway, the apparatus comprising:\na transmitter and receiver for wireless communication with at least one base station arranged at a predetermined position in the vicinity of the railway; a measurement device to determine a distance to said at least one base station based on measurements of the radio signals of said wireless communication in at least one of the time domain and the phase domain; and a controller arranged to determine a present position of said vehicle on said railway based on said distance.",
    "15. The apparatus of claim 14, wherein the apparatus is comprised within a mobile router arranged within the rail-bound vehicle.",
    "16. A method for determining a position of a rail-bound vehicle on a railway, the method comprising:\nproviding wireless communication with at least one base station arranged at a predetermined position in the vicinity of the railway; measuring a distance to said at least one base station based on measurements of the radio signals of said wireless communication in at least one of the time domain and the phase domain; and determining a present position of said vehicle on said railway based on said distance."
