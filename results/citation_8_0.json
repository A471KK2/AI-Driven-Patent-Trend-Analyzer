  "abstract": "The invention discloses a diffusion breeding and releasing method for preventing myzus persicae through harmonia axyridis. The myzus persicae is bred in a diffusion breeding shed, and an insect-proof net (7) covers the diffusion breeding shed; a tobacco seedling is cultivated through a floating method; when the tobacco seedling has five to six true leaves, tobacco leaves with the myzus persicae are put on the tobacco seedling to breed the myzus persicae; male and female harmonia axyridis adults captured in the wild are put into the insect-proof net, eat the myzus persicae and then mate to lay eggs; the eggs are incubated into larvae, or low-age larvae are directly collected, or after the larvae are pupated, pupae are taken back for eclosion at room temperature; the eclosion adults are fed with the myzus persicae and are put into a refrigerator for refrigeration and storage; the low-age larvae or the adults of the harmonia axyridis are put into a low-age larva transporting and releasing device (9) or an adult transporting and releasing device (10); the low-age larvae or the adults of the harmonia axyridis are released to a field according to a ratio of the harmonia axyridis to the myzus persicae of 1:(100-120) in a preliminary forming stage of the myzus persicae in the field. According to the method, the breeding speed rate of the harmonia axyridis can be remarkably improved, and the field pest control efficiency is improved in a mode of preventing the myzus persicae through the harmonia axyridis.",
