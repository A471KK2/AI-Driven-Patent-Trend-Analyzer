  "abstract": "The invention discloses a microcapsule insecticide-fertilizer preparation, a preparation method and application thereof. The preparation consists of the following components in part by weight: 1 to 30 parts of pesticide microcapsules and 70 to 99 parts of nutrient substance. The preparation method mainly comprises the following steps of: after fully dissolving a pesticide with a solvent, adding a wall material monomer into solution and mixing uniformly; transporting a mixture into a shear dispersion reaction kettle which is filled with smashed capsule bodies; stirring the mixture and the capsule bodies so that the capsules fully absorb the solution; performing a shear dispersion reaction to form capsules; performing solid-liquid separation and drying to prepare the pesticide microcapsules; adding the nutrient substances into the pesticide microcapsules; and fully stirring and uniformly mixing to prepare the microcapsule insecticide-fertilizer preparation. By using the microcapsule insecticide-fertilizer preparation and the preparation method, the problems of the chemical compatibility and the physical stability of the conventional insecticide-fertilizer preparation in the same system are solved effectively. A product of the invention has the advantages of: shielding and slow-releasing functions, high chemical compatibility and physical stability, lasting pesticide effect, natural degradability, no environment pollution, low use cost and simple production process.",
