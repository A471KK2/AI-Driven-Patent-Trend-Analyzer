Other ingredients that can be used include: starch, flour and paper acetates; gelatin; boric acid; and agricultural fillers. The solid ingredients are combined and fed to an extruder used to make pellets or to feed injection molding equipment. The resulting parts are clear to white or colorful depending upon the added filler materials. The plastics formed are water resistant, high strength and biodegradable.",

A method of forming a biodegradable plastic, the method comprising the following steps:combining on a per weight basis between about 10% to 60% by weight whole starch granules, and between 30% to 70% cellulose acetate which has a molecular weight ranging from 28,000 to 62,000 and a viscosity of 3 to 44 seconds to form a first mixture of dry ingredients; combining between 5% and 35% of a plasticizer selected from the group consisting of triacetin, diacetin, monoacetin, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol and glycerol, with said first mixture of dry ingredients to form a free flowing second mixture; extruding said second mixture through a die to form pellets of plastic having at least 3% intact starch granules; and processing the pellets through an injection molder to produce molded items.",
    "17. The method of claim 16 wherein a temperature between 100\u00b0 C. and 170\u00b0 C. is maintained for all heated zones including the die.",
    "18. A method of forming a biodegradable plastic, the method comprising the following steps:combining on a per weight basis between about 10% to 60% by weight whole starch granules, and between 30% to 70% cellulose acetate which has a molecular weight ranging from 28,000 to 62,000 and a viscosity of 3 to 44seconds to form a first mixture of dry ingredients; combining between 5% and 35% of a plasticizer selected from the group consisting of triacetin, diacetin, monoacetin, propylene glycol, glycerol and ethylene glycol, to said first mixture of dry ingredients to form a second mixture which is a free flowing uniform powder; and extruding said second mixture through a heated barrel directly into injection molds to form a plastic having at least 3% intact starch granules.",
