  "abstract": "The invention discloses a release control imidacloprid granular pesticide which mainly comprises imidacloprid, an auxiliary material and sulphur, wherein the imidacloprid adopts 10 percent imidacloprid wettable powder, and the auxiliary material adopts starch. A preparation method of the release control imidacloprid granular pesticide comprises the following steps of: after mixing the imidacloprid with the starch in certain proportion according to the content of effective components of the imidacloprid in proportion and granulating to form a medicament core granule; then melting the sulphur; and coating the sulphur, sealing, cooling, conditioning and screening to obtain the release control imidacloprid granular pesticide. According to the invention, the release speed of the effective components can be effectively adjusted; and the release control imidacloprid granular pesticide can be applied once and plays a role for a long time, thereby saving labor force, reducing the pollution of pesticide on soil and the environment thereof and effectively improving the biological pest controlling effect.",
