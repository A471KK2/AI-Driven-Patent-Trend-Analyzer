The method of claim 15, wherein the transport task is associated with a requested item, wherein the first type of UAV is arranged to transport one or more items having a collective weight up to a first weight, wherein the second type of UAV is arranged to transport one or more items having a collective weight up to a second weight, wherein the second weight is greater than the first weight, and wherein determining, based on the first UAV being of the first type, that the first UAV meets the criteria for the transport task comprises:\nbased on the first UAV being of the first type, determining that the first UAV is arranged to transport the requested item that is of a weight lesser than the first weight.",
    "17. The method of claim 15, wherein the transport task is associated with a requested item, wherein the first type of UAV is arranged to transport one or more items having a collective size up to a first size, wherein the second type of UAV is arranged to transport one or more items having a collective size up to a second seize, wherein the second size is greater than the first size, and wherein determining, based on the first UAV being of the first type, that the first UAV meets the criteria for the transport task comprises:\nbased on the first UAV being of the first type, determining that the first UAV is arranged to transport the requested item that is of a size lesser than the first size.",
    "18. The method of claim 15, wherein the second type of UAV is arranged to perform tethered delivery of payloads without use of doors to enable loading and release of payloads.",
    "19. A method comprising:\ndetermining, by a control system, that an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is at a pickup location for pickup of a payload, wherein the UAV comprises a fuselage having a door and a chamber arranged to house the payload; in response to determining that the UAV is at the pickup location for pickup of the payload, causing, by the control system, an opening of the door to enable loading of the payload into the chamber; determining, by the control system, that the UAV is at a delivery location for delivery of the payload; and in response to determining that the UAV is at a delivery location for delivery of the payload, causing, by the control system, an opening of the door to enable release of the payload from the chamber.",
    "20. The method of claim 19, wherein the fuselage has a bottom side that is substantially oriented towards the ground during flight of the UAV, and wherein the door is arranged on a top side that is substantially opposite the bottom side.",
    "21. The method of claim 19, wherein the fuselage has a bottom side that is substantially oriented towards the ground during flight of the UAV, and wherein the door is arranged on the bottom side.",
    "22. The method of claim 19, wherein the fuselage has (i) a bottom side that is substantially oriented towards the ground during flight of the UAV and (ii) a top side that is substantially opposite the bottom side, and wherein the door is arranged on the bottom side, the method further comprising:\nwhile the UAV is at the pickup location for pickup of the payload, causing, by the control system, the UAV to carry out a flip maneuver, wherein the flip maneuver comprising the UAV landing substantially on the top side, wherein causing the opening of the door to enable loading of the payload into the chamber comprises causing the opening of the door to enable loading of the payload into the chamber after completion of the flip maneuver."
