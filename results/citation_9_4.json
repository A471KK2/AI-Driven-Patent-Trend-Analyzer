  "abstract": "The invention discloses a seed coating agent specially used for direct seeding rice, which is characterized in that the seed coating agent mainly contains the following ingredients by weight: 2 to 8 percent of super absorbent resin, 1 to 5 percent of oxygenates, 0.1 to 0.5 percent of sparrow and rat destruction agent , 0.5 to 2 percent of bactericide, 0.5 to 2 percent of pesticide, 0.02 to 0.2 percent of plant growth regulator, 3 to 10 percent of trace element fertilizer and the margin is special type mineral clay. The powder raw materials are crushed to more then 100 meshes and are mixed evenly, the mixture is coated on the surfaces of rice seeds by a seed-coating method for direct sowing, thus clay sacculus integrating 'a small water reservoir, a small oxygen reservoir, a small drug storage and a small fertilizer storage' are formed around the rice seeds and at the roots of seedlings; the seed coating agent has the effects of preserving and providing water, ventilating and providing oxygen, promoting seedling emergency, preventing diseases and killing pests, preventing mice and destructing sparrows, strengthening seedlings and roots and increasing production. The seed coating agent is also characterized by low dosage, low cost, simple and convenient operation, and the like, thereby being applicable to coating rice seeds which are directly sowed both on flooded paddy fields and dry paddy fields.",
