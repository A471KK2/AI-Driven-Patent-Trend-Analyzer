A method of manufacturing a wing, comprising:\nproviding a wing frame, wherein the wing frame comprises a primary spar, a drag spar, a plurality of transverse frame elements comprising a spar joiner, and a plurality of mounting elements, wherein the primary spar is coupled to the drag spar via the spar joiner; placing the wing frame into a mold, wherein the mold defines a shape of the wing; injecting the mold with an uncured material; and allowing the uncured material to cure to form an air-filled matrix material, such that the air-filled matrix material substantially encases the wing frame and fills the defined shape of the wing, and such that the plurality of transverse frame elements provide torsional rigidity to the wing.",
    "2. The method of manufacturing a wing of claim 1, wherein providing the wing frame comprises assembling the wing frame.",
    "3. The method of manufacturing a wing of claim 2, wherein placing the wing frame into the mold comprises placing the wing frame into the mold after the wing frame has been assembled.",
    "4. The method of manufacturing a wing of claim 1, further comprising:\nforming a wing skin, wherein the wing skin corresponds to the defined shape of the wing; and applying the wing skin to the surface of the air-filled matrix material such that the wing skin substantially surrounds the air-filled matrix material.",
    "5. The method of manufacturing a wing of claim 1, further comprising shielding the mounting elements while injecting the mold with the uncured material such that the as-molded wing is couplable to additional elements of an aerial vehicle.",
