  "abstract": "This disclosure is generally directed to a High Speed vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft that includes fixed wing flight capabilities. The High Speed VTOL aircraft may include at least two thrust producing rotors located equidistant from a longitudinal axis of the aircraft on a main wing, and at least two thrust producing rotors located equidistant from a longitudinal axis of the aircraft on a vertical wing. The rotors may be driven by electric motors. However, other power sources may be used such as combustion or hybrid engines. By adjusting the speed and/or the pitch of the rotors, the aircraft can transition from a vertical flight configuration to a horizontal flight configuration and back.",
