The computer storage medium of claim 19, wherein the operations further comprise:\nautonomously perform a flight path; disperse chemical along the flight path; periodically determine the occurrence of a spraying cessation event, wherein the spraying cessation event is a determined temperature inversion; cease dispersing the chemical if the occurrence of a spraying cessation event has been determined; determine whether to resume spraying of the chemical; and resume spraying of the chemical along the flight path.",
    "24. The computer storage medium of claim 19, wherein the operations further comprise:\nautonomously perform a flight path, wherein the UAV has one or more motors connected to operating spinning propellers; cease rotation of one or more motors of the UAV, the motors connected to propellers; disperse chemical along the flight path; cease dispersing the chemical along the flight path; and start rotation of the one or more ceased more of the UAV thereby providing forward thrust to the UAV."
