  "abstract": "A solar powered aircraft including a modular main wing and a pair of relatively large modular winglets attached to the transverse end portions of the main wing. To collect solar radiation, including relatively low-angle radiation, solar panels are mounted to both the main wing and the winglets. In some embodiments, the aspect ratio of the main wing is relatively low, such as between 9 and 15, i.e., the main wing is relatively deep compared to its wing span. In some embodiments, the winglets are relatively long, such as in the range of 0.2 to 0.7 times the length of the main wing semi-span. In some embodiments, a truss-like spar passes through and helps support the wing and the winglets.",

    "1. An aircraft, comprising:\na main wing characterized by a wing span, a wing area and an aspect ratio; first and second winglets attached to a respective transverse end portion of the main wing at a fixed angle between 75-100 degrees with respect to a plane defined by the main wing, each of the winglets characterized by a winglet span; and a solar power system including at least one solar panel mounted to each of the main wing, the first winglet and the second winglet; wherein the winglet span is between 0.2 and 0.7.",
    "2. The aircraft of claim 1, wherein the main wing and the winglets each include a plurality of modular wing panels and a truss-type spar passing through the wing panels.",
    "3. The aircraft of claim 1, wherein a chord of each winglet is equal to a chord of the main wing where the winglet meets the main wing.",
    "4. The aircraft of claim 3, wherein the chord of each winglet and the chord of the main wing are all constant.",
    "5. The aircraft of claim 1, further comprising a plurality of propulsion modules, each propulsion module disposed between a pair of adjacent wing panels.",
    "6. The aircraft of claim 5, further comprising at least one fuselage module disposed between a pair of adjacent wing panels.",
    "7. The aircraft of claim 1, wherein the aspect ratio is between 9 and 15.",
    "8. An aircraft, comprising:\na main wing characterized by a wing span, a wing area and an aspect ratio; first and second winglets attached to a respective transverse end portion of the main wing at a fixed angle, each of the winglets characterized by a winglet span between 0.2 and 0.7; and a solar power system including at least one solar panel mounted to each of the main wing, the first winglet and the second winglet.",
    "9. The aircraft of claim 8, wherein each winglet is attached to the main wing at an angle between 60-100 degrees with respect to a plane defined by the main wing.",
    "10. The aircraft of claim 8, wherein the aspect ratio is between 9 and 15.",
    "11. The aircraft of claim 8, wherein the main wing and the winglets each include a plurality of modular wing panels and a truss-type spar passing through the wing panels.",

    "13. The aircraft of claim 8, wherein the main wing includes a plurality of modular wing panels and a wing spar passing through the wing panels, and wherein the wing spar includes a plurality of spar sections with substantially rectangular cross sections.",
    "14. A method of improving aircraft performance, comprising:\nproviding a main wing characterized by a wing span, a wing area and an aspect ratio; attaching first and second winglets to a respective transverse end portion of the main wing at a fixed angle, each of the winglets characterized by a winglet span; and mounting at least one solar panel to each of the main wing, the first winglet and the second winglet; wherein the aspect ratio is between 9 and 15.",
    "15. The method of claim 14, wherein the winglet span is between 0.2 and 0.7.",
    "16. The method of claim 15, wherein the winglet span is between 0.3 and 0.5.",
    "17. The method of claim 14, wherein the main wing and the winglets are each further characterized by a chord, and wherein the chord of each winglet and the chord of the main wing are all constant and equal to each other.",
