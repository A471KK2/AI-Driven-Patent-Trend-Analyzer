  "abstract": "The present invention relates to a catch system for guiding a multi-copter to a position in a precise position during takeoff and descent.  The present invention further relates to a monorail guard system equipped with the catch system.  The present invention relates to a pull cord,  A winding device for winding the tow line,  A multi-copter catch system comprising a control device for controlling the winding and winding of the winding device has been developed.  The present invention further provides a monorail system comprising a monorail connecting a strut and a strut between consecutive repetitive installations of a strut, a traveling car to travel on a connected monorail, and a control unit to control the traveling unit,  And a sensor device including sensor devices capable of transmitting and receiving visible light, heat, sound waves, and laser lights up and down, front and rear, left and right,  An arithmetic processing unit for receiving the measured signal from the sensor equipment mounted on the bogie unit and for comparing the received signal with a reference value, And a flight control system for transmitting a takeoff signal to the monorail control system.  According to the present invention, the problem of inaccurate takeoff and landing of a multi-copter operated by conventional low-altitude electric power is solved. In addition, it can be applied to various expense and surveillance systems, enabling effective unmanned surveillance without introducing expensive equipment.",
