While hard and soft polymers each possess certain intrinsic benefits, certain blends of hard and soft polymers have been discovered which possess synergistic properties superior to those of either hard or soft polymers by themselves. Biodegradable polymers include polyesters, polyesteramides, polyesterurethanes, thermoplastic starch, and other natural polymers. The polymer blends may optionally include an inorganic filler. Films and sheets made from the polymer blends may be textured so as to increase the bulk hand feel. Wraps will typically be manufactured to have good \u201cdead-fold\u201d properties so as to remain in a wrapped position and not spring back to an \u201cunwrapped\u201d form.",
